Donating
========

Syncthing and SyncTrayzor are free software, and you don't need to pay a penny to use them.
However, if you find them useful, please consider giving a small amount to one of the causes below.

Syncthing
---------

SyncTrayzor is just the wrapper around [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net), which makes it look and behave like a native Windows application.
The heavy lifting is being done by Syncthing.

While development is done for free by a fantastic team, running the infrastructure which lets your devices find and talk to each other costs money, as does hosting things like the [website](https://syncthing.net) and [forum](https://forum.syncthing.net).
If you make use of these, I kindly ask that you consider sending a small amount towards funding Syncthing's running costs and future development.
Donations are handled by the Syncthing Foundation, whose accounts are public.
