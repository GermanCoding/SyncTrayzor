VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The setup binary is identical to the binaries published in official releases, available at:
https://github.com/GermanCoding/SyncTrayzor/releases/
All binaries are accompanied by a PGP signed checksum file. How to verify the full signature
is explained in the security README:
https://github.com/GermanCoding/SyncTrayzor/blob/main/security/README.md

If you trust your HTTPS connection to GitHub, a simpler method is also available:

1. Navigate to the corresponding GitHub release, e.g.
    https://github.com/GermanCoding/SyncTrayzor/releases/tag/v{version}
2. Copy the checksum of the SyncTrayzorSetup-x64.exe file as displayed by GitHub on the assets tab
3. Compute the SHA-256 checksum of the setup file included with choco, e.g.
    $ (Get-FileHash SyncTrayzorSetup-x64.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
4. Verify hashes from step 2 and 3 are identical

This package is published by the developer of SyncTrayzor v2, directly from the automated
