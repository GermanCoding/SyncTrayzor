    <summary>Windows tray utility / launcher for Syncthing</summary>
    <description>SyncTrayzor is a little tray utility for [Syncthing](http://syncthing.net/) on Windows.
It hosts and wraps Syncthing, making it behave more like a native Windows application and less like a command-line utility with a web browser interface.

## Features

- Has a built-in web browser, so you don't need to fire up an external browser.
- Optionally starts on login, so you don't need to set up Syncthing as a service.
- Has drop-box style file download / progress window
- Tray icon indicates when synchronization is occurring.
- Alerts you when:
  - You have file conflicts
  - One of your folders is out of sync
  - Folders finish syncing
  - Devices connect / disconnect
- Has a tool to help you resolve file conflicts
- Contains translations for many languages

## Information

- This chocolatey package has recently changed maintainership from canton7 to GermanCoding (SyncTrayzor v2 fork).
- Homepage: https://github.com/GermanCoding/SyncTrayzor (source code, discussions, issues)

## Uninstallation

- When uninstalling, SyncTrayzor can optionally remove syncthing configuration as well. As this is a potentially destructive action, it is not performed by default. To enable it, use the following command:

  ```powershell
  choco uninstall synctrayzor --params /DeleteAll
  ```

  Without this argument, your syncthing binary, configuration and database are kept on the machine (which allows for safe re-installs).
